# Cyber Range Network Exercise Development (Broken Authentication)

This is a project I worked on with 3 other students as<br>
my senior project for school. The task was to develop<br>
an exercise for an entry level cyber security class.<br>
We decided rather than have one large exercise, we<br>
would develop several small exercises to give students<br>
exposure to more potential exploits. To organize this<br>
we decided to create a Jupyter Notebook that contained<br>
all of the exercises. To access the Notebook, students<br>
would have to access a website provided by their<br>
professor which would allow them to access a virtual<br>
machine where the exercises are stored.<br><br>

As for my exercise, I was tasked with was developing a <br>
broken authentication exploit. The basic summary is<br>
students would get a list of randomly generated<br>
passwords. Among these passwords was a correct password<br>
that they would have to use to login to a dummy page.<br>
The dummy page would contain a token that the student<br>
must grab and put in a url. If the token is correct,<br>
The student would be given access to a phrase that<br>
they can copy and paste, and put in a Jupyter Notebook<br>
cell to complete the exercise.<br><br>

I included the README that I gave professors in the<br>
"E2_Broken_Authentiaction" directory which goes into<br>
more depth of how it works and the different files<br>
used. Since this is all very difficult to explain<br>
in text, I also included the video I used to<br>
demonstrate how everything works.<br>
